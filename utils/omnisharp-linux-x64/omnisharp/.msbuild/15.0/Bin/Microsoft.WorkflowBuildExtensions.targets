   <!-- 
        With MSBuild 12, we've changed MSBuildToolsPath to for the first time point to a directory
        outside of the .NET Framework.  As a result of this, there were several targets files, of which 
        this was one, that were being referenced as out of MSBuildToolsPath that are now no longer there.  

        Thus, we are shimming those targets files so that they do still appear in MSBuildToolsPath, so that 
        consumers of them are not broken, but since the targets files themselves are still part of .NET, 
        the shim will internally simply redirect to the real copy of the targets file in the .NET Framework.
