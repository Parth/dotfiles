RELEASE NOTES FOR 2.0.1

This release is mostly a brown-bag release. Not so nice for the second release
ever of the product, but that's what I get for trying to get something out
there that I hadn't fully looked through one last time.

CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS

The documentation regarding the assertTrue() and assertFalse() functions was
updated to reflect their proper usage. They are shell test condition evaluators
(e.g. "[1 -eq 2]") rather than simple 0/1 comparators.


BUG FIXES

The fail*() functions were doing the exact opposite of what they were supposed
to be doing. They have been fixed.


DEPRECATED FEATURES

None.


KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES

None.
