CHANGES WITH 2.0.3

Back ported the Makefile from 2.1.1pre that included changes to the
docs-docbook-prep target.

Changed the test in assertFalse() so that any non-zero value registers as
false. (Credits to Bryan Larsen)

Updated the testPartyLikeItIs1999() function in the Quick Start documentation.
The 'expected' and 'actual' values were swapped. (Credits to Richard Jensen)

It was pointed out that the simple 'failed' message for a failed assert was not
only insufficient, it was nonstandard (when compared to JUnit) and didn't
provide the user with an expected vs actual result. The code was revised
somewhat to bring closer into alignment with JUnit (v4.3.1 specifically) so
that it feels more "normal". (Credits to Richard Jensen)

As part of the JUnit realignment, it was noticed that fail*() functions in
JUnit don't actually do any comparisons themselves. They only generate a
failure message. Updated the code to match.

Added self-testing unit tests. Kinda horkey, but they did find bugs during the
JUnit realignment.

Fixed the code for returning from asserts as the return was being called before
the unsetting of variables occurred. (Credits to Mathias Goldau)

The assert(True|False)() functions now accept an integer value for a
conditional test. A value of '0' is considered 'true', while any non-zero value
is considered 'false'.

All public functions now fill use default values to work properly with the '-x'
shell debugging flag.

Fixed the method of percent calculation for the report to get achieve better
accuracy.


CHANGES WITH 2.0.2

Fixed problem with fail(). The failure message was not properly printed.

Reworked the Makefile so that the DocBook XML and XSLT files are properly
downloaded before parsing can continue.


CHANGES WITH 2.0.1

Fixed some really stupid mistakes with the fail* functions. They were doing the
exact opposite of what they were supposed to be doing.


CHANGES WITH 2.0.0

Made the first stand-alone release!
