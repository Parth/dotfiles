CHANGES WITH 2.0.2

Fixed problem with fail(). The failure message was not properly printed.

Reworked the Makefile so that the DocBook XML and XSLT files are properly
downloaded before parsing can continue.


CHANGES WITH 2.0.1

Fixed some really stupid mistakes with the fail* functions. They were doing the
exact opposite of what they were supposed to be doing.


CHANGES WITH 2.0.0

Made the first stand-alone release!
