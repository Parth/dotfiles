# Changes in version 0.5.0


## Performance improvements:

We thank Sebastian Gniazdowski and "m0viefreak" for significant contributions
in this area.

- Optimize string operations in the `main` (default) highlighter.
  (#372/3cb58fd7d7b9, 02229ebd6328, ef4bfe5bcc14, #372/c6b6513ac0d6, #374/15461e7d21c3)

- Command word highlighting:  Use the `zsh/parameter` module to avoid forks.
  Memoize (cache) the results.
  (#298, 3ce01076b521, 2f18ba64e397, 12b879caf7a6; #320, 3b67e656bff5)

- Avoid forks in the driver and in the `root` highlighter.
  (b9112aec798a, 38c8fbea2dd2)


## Added highlighting of:

- `pkexec` (a precommand).
  (#248, 4f3910cbbaa5)

- Aliases that cannot be defined normally nor invoked normally (highlighted as an error).
  (#263 (in part), 28932316cca6)

- Path separators (`/`) — the default behaviour remains to highlight path separators
  and path components the same way.
  (#136, #260, 6cd39e7c70d3, 9a934d291e7c, f3d3aaa00cc4)

- Assignments to individual positional arguments (`42=foo` to assign to `$42`).
  (f4036a09cee3)

- Linewise region (the `visual-line-mode` widget, bound to `V` in zsh's `vi` keymap).
  (#267, a7a7f8b42280, ee07588cfd9b)

- Command-lines recalled by `isearch` mode; requires zsh≥5.3.
  (#261 (in part); #257; 4ad311ec0a68)

- Command-lines whilst the `IGNORE_BRACES` or `IGNORE_CLOSE_BRACES` option is in effect.
  (a8a6384356af, 02807f1826a5)

- Mismatched parentheses and braces (in the `main` highlighter).
  (51b9d79c3bb6, 2fabf7ca64b7, a4196eda5e6f, and others)

- Mismatched `do`/`done` keywords.
  (b2733a64da93)

- Mismatched `foreach`/`end` keywords.
  (#96, 2bb8f0703d8f)

- In Bourne-style function definitions, when the `MULTI_FUNC_DEF` option is set
  (which is the default), highlight the first word in the function body as
  a command word: `f() { g "$@" }`.
  (6f91850a01e1)

- `always` blocks.
  (#335, e5782e4ddfb6)

- Command substitutions inside double quotes, `"$(echo foo)"`.
  (#139 (in part), c3913e0d8ead)

- Non-alphabetic parameters inside double quotes (`"$$"`, `"$#"`, `"$*"`, `"$@"`, `"$?"`, `"$-"`).
  (4afe670f7a1b, 44ef6e38e5a7)

- Command words from future versions of zsh (forward compatibly).
  This also adds an `arg0` style that all other command word styles fall back to.
  (b4537a972eed, bccc3dc26943)

- Escaped history expansions inside double quotes: `: "\!"`
  (28d7056a7a06, et seq)


## Fixed highlighting of:

- Command separator tokens in syntactically-invalid positions.
  (09c4114eb980)

- Redirections with a file descriptor number at command word.
  (#238 (in part), 73ee7c1f6c4a)

- The `select` prompt, `$PS3`.
  (#268, 451665cb2a8b)

- Values of variables in `vared`.
  (e500ca246286)

- `!` as an argument (neither a history expansion nor a reserved word).
  (4c23a2fd1b90)

- "division by zero" error under the `brackets` highlighter when `$ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES` is empty.
  (f73f3d53d3a6)

- Process substitutions, `<(pwd)` and `>(wc -l)`.
  (#302, 6889ff6bd2ad, bfabffbf975c, fc9c892a3f15)

- The non-`SHORT_LOOPS` form of `repeat` loops: `repeat 42; do true; done`.
  (#290, 4832f18c50a5, ef68f50c048f, 6362c757b6f7)

- Broken symlinks (are now highlighted as files).
  (#342, 95f7206a9373, 53083da8215e)

- Lines accepted from `isearch` mode.
  (#284; #257, #259, #288; 5bae6219008b, a8fe22d42251)

- Work around upstream bug that triggered when the command word was a relative
  path, that when interpreted relative to a $PATH directory denoted a command;
  the effect of that upstream bug was that the relative path was cached as
  a "valid external command name".
  (#354, #355, 51614ca2c994, fdaeec45146b, 7d38d07255e4;
  upstream fix slated to be released in 5.3 (workers/39104))

- After accepting a line with the cursor on a bracket, the matching bracket
  of the bracket under the cursor no longer remains highlighted (with the
  `brackets` highlighter).
  (4c4baede519a)

- The first word on a new line within an array assignment or initialization is no
  longer considered a command position.
  (8bf423d16d46)

- Subshells that end at command position, `(A=42)`, `(true;)`.
  (#231, 7fb6f9979121; #344, 4fc35362ee5a)

- Command word after array assignment, `a=(lorem ipsum) pwd`.
  (#330, 7fb6f9979121)


## API changes (for highlighter authors):

- New interface `_zsh_highlight_add_highlight`.
  (341a3ae1f015, c346f6eb6fb6)

- tests: Specify the style key, not its value, in test expectations.
  (a830613467af, fd061b5730bf, eaa4335c3441, among others)

- Module author documentation improvements.
  (#306 (in part), 217669270418, 0ff354b44b6e, 80148f6c8402, 364f206a547f, and others)

- The driver no longer defines a `_zsh_highlight_${highlighter}_highlighter_cache`
  variable, which is in the highlighters' namespace.
  (3e59ab41b6b8, 80148f6c8402, f91a7b885e7d)

- Rename highlighter entry points.  The old names remain supported for
  backwards compatibility.
  (a3d5dfcbdae9, c793e0dceab1)

- tests: Add the "NONE" expectation.
  (4da9889d1545, 13018f3dd735, d37c55c788cd)

- tests: consider a test that writes to stderr to have failed.
  (#291, 1082067f9315)


## Developer-visible changes:

- Add `make quiet-test`.
  (9b64ad750f35)

- test harness: Better quote replaceables in error messages.
  (30d8f92df225)

- test harness: Fix exit code for XPASS.
  (bb8d325c0cbd)

- Create [HACKING.md](HACKING.md).
  (cef49752fd0e)

- tests: Emit a description for PASS test points.
  (6aa57d60aa64, f0bae44b76dd)

- tests: Create a script that generates a test file.
  (8013dc3b8db6, et seq; `tests/generate.zsh`)


## Other changes:

- Under zsh≤5.2, widgets whose names start with a `_` are no longer excluded
  from highlighting.
  (ed33d2cb1388; reverts part of 186d80054a40 which was for #65)

- Under zsh≤5.2, widgets implemented by a function named after the widget are
  no longer excluded from highlighting.
  (487b122c480d; reverts part of 776453cb5b69)

- Under zsh≤5.2, shell-unsafe widget names can now be wrapped.
  (#278, 6a634fac9fb9, et seq)

  for msys2 compatibility.
  (#292, d4f8edc9f3ad)

  (#305, d711563fe1bf, 295d62ec888d, f3242cbd6aba)

- Fix warnings when `WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL` is set prior to sourcing zsh-syntax-highlighting.
  (z-sy-h already sets `WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL` internally.)
  (da60234fb236)

- Warn only once, rather than once per keypress, when a highlighter is unavailable.
  (0a9b347483ae)


# Changes in version 0.4.1

## Fixes:

- Arguments to widgets were not properly dash-escaped.  Only matters for widgets
  that take arguments (i.e., that are invoked as `zle ${widget} -- ${args}`).

  (#228, 96ee5116b182)

  (#186, 6e3720f39d84)

        A=1;

    (The semicolon used to be highlighted as a mistake)

- cursor highlighter: Remove the cursor highlighting when accepting a line.
  (#109, 4f0c293fdef0)
