=======================

**[Fish shell][fish]-like like syntax highlighting for [Zsh][zsh].**

*Requirements: zsh 4.3.17+.*

[fish]: http://www.fishshell.com/
[zsh]: http://www.zsh.org/

This package provides syntax highlighing for the shell zsh.  It enables
highlighing of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an
interactive terminal.  This helps in reviewing commands before running
them, particularly in catching syntax errors.

Some examples:

FAQ
---

### Why must `zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh` be sourced at the end of the `.zshrc` file?

`zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh` wraps ZLE widgets.  It must be sourced after all
custom widgets have been created (i.e., after all `zle -N` calls and after
running `compinit`).  Widgets created later will work, but will not update the
syntax highlighting.

### Does syntax highlighting work during incremental history search?

Yes!

If you're using `history-incremental-search-backward` (by default bound to <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd>
in zsh's emacs keymap) then it works with _zsh version 5.3 and newer_.

If you're using `history-incremental-pattern-search-backward`, then syntax highlighting works
in _zsh 5.3.2 and newer_ due to [a bug in zsh](http://www.zsh.org/cgi-bin/mla/redirect?WORKERNUMBER=40285).

Under zshÂ 5.2 and older, the zsh-default [underlining][zshzle-Character-Highlighting]
of the matched portion of the buffer remains available, but zsh-syntax-highlighting's
additional highlighting is unavailable.  (Those versions of zsh do not provide
enough information to allow computing the highlighting correctly.)

See [issue #288][i288] for details.

### How are new releases announced?

There is currently no "push" announcements channel.  However, the following
alternatives exist:

- GitHub's RSS feed of releases: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/releases.atom
- An anitya entry: https://release-monitoring.org/project/7552/


How to tweak
------------

Syntax highlighting is done by pluggable highlighter scripts.  See the
[documentation on highlighters](docs/highlighters.md) for details and
configuration settings.
