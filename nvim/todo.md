+ run actions (codelens)
+ still some disatisfactory hanging lsp behaviors
+ flow for hitting cargo clippy and jumping through all the problems
+ restore the file progress (there are no scrollbars)
+ use clippy instead of cargo check (it's a rust config -- checkOnSave)
+ show full path, so when you <leader>gd inside a crate you know where you are
+ rust lsp function accept add ()
+ tree goto next diagnostic same way as lsp
+ find current file in tree (cntrl 1 or something)
+ dark mode light mode syntax highlighting is still kinda busted
