DESCRIPTION

      Obtains access credentials for the Google Cloud Platform resources of the

      credentials, it is set as active without re-running the web flow.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      [ACCOUNT]

         The account to log in as.

FLAGS

      --do-not-activate

         Do not set the new credentials as active.

      --force

         Re-run the web flow even if the given account has valid credentials.

      --no-launch-browser

         Print a URL to be copied instead of launching a web browser.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
