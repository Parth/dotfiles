DESCRIPTION

      The gcloud CLI manages authentication, local configuration, developer
      workflow, and interactions with the Google Cloud Platform APIs.

FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      --user-output-enabled USER_OUTPUT_ENABLED

         Control whether user intended output is printed to the console.
         (true/false)

      --verbosity VERBOSITY

         Override the default verbosity for this command. This must be a
         standard logging verbosity level: [debug, info, warning, error,
         critical, none] (Default: [warning]).
