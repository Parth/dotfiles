DESCRIPTION

      Imports data into a Cloud SQL instance from Google Cloud Storage.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      INSTANCE

         Cloud SQL instance ID.

      URI [URI ...]

         Path to the MySQL dump file in Google Cloud Storage from which the
         import is made. The URI is in the form gs://bucketName/fileName.
         Compressed gzip files (.gz) are also supported.

FLAGS

      --async

         Do not wait for the operation to complete.

      --database DATABASE, -d DATABASE

         The database (for example, guestbook) to which the import is made. If
         not set, it is assumed that the database is specified in the file to be
         imported.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
