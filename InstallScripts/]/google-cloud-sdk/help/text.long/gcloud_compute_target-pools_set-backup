NAME

      gcloud compute target-pools set-backup - set a backup pool for a target
         pool

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-pools set-backup NAME --backup-pool [BACKUP_POOL]
         [--failover-ratio FAILOVER_RATIO] [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--region REGION]
         [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-pools set-backup is used to set a backup target pool
      for a primary target pool, which defines the fallback behavior of the
      primary pool. If the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is
      at or below the specified --failover-ratio value, then traffic arriving at
      the load-balanced IP address will be directed to the backup pool.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target pool for which to set the backup pool.

FLAGS

      --backup-pool [BACKUP_POOL]

         Name of the target pool that will serve as backup. If this flag is
         provided without a value, the existing backup pool is removed.

      --failover-ratio FAILOVER_RATIO

         The new failover ratio value for the target pool. This must be a float
         in the range of [0, 1].

      --region REGION

         The region of the target pool to set a backup pool for. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To cause TARGET-POOL (in region us-central1) to fail over to BACKUP-POOL
      when more than half of the TARGET-POOL instances are unhealthy, run:

        $ gcloud compute target-pools set-backup TARGET-POOL \
            --backup-pool BACKUP-POOL --failover-ratio 0.5 \
            --region us-central1

      To remove BACKUP-POOL as a backup to TARGET-POOL, run:

        $ gcloud compute target-pools set-backup TARGET-POOL --backup-pool \
            --region us-central1

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
