         [--access-config-name ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--network-interface NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"]

         [--zone ZONE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances delete-access-config is used to delete access
      configurations from network interfaces of Google Compute Engine virtual
      machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the instance from which to delete the access configuration.

FLAGS

      --access-config-name ACCESS_CONFIG_NAME; default="external-nat"

         Specifies the name of the access configuration to delete. external-nat
         is used as the default if this flag is not provided.

      --network-interface NETWORK_INTERFACE; default="nic0"

         Specifies the name of the network interface from which to delete the
         access configuration. If this is not provided, then nic0 is used as the
         default.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to delete an access config from. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
