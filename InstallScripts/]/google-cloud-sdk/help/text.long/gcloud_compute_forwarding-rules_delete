      gcloud compute forwarding-rules delete - delete forwarding rules

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules delete NAME [NAME ...] [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--global |
          --region REGION] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules delete deletes one or more Google Compute
      Engine forwarding rules.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME [NAME ...]

         The names of the forwarding rules to delete.

FLAGS

      --global

         If provided, assume the forwarding rules are global. A forwarding rule
         is global if it references a target HTTP proxy.

      --region REGION

         The region of the forwarding rule to operate on. If not specified, you
         will be prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
