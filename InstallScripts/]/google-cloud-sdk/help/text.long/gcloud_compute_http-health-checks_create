DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute http-health-checks create is used to create an HTTP health
      check. HTTP health checks monitor instances in a load balancer controlled
      by a target pool. All arguments to the command are optional except for the
      name of the health check. For more information on load balancing, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the HTTP health check.

FLAGS

      --check-interval CHECK_INTERVAL; default="5s"

         How often to perform a health check for an instance. For example,
         specifying 10s will run the check every 10 seconds. Valid units for
         this flag are s for seconds, m for minutes, and h for hours. The
         default value is 5s.

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the HTTP health check.

      --healthy-threshold HEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default="2"

         The number of consecutive successful health checks before an unhealthy
         instance is marked as healthy. The default is 2.

      --host HOST

         The value of the host header used in this HTTP health check request. By
         default, this is empty and Google Compute Engine automatically sets the
         host header in health requests to the same external IP address as the
         forwarding rule associated with the target pool.

      --port PORT; default="80"

         The TCP port number that this health check monitors. The default value
         is 80.

      --request-path REQUEST_PATH; default="/"

         The request path that this health check monitors. For example,
         /healthcheck. The default value is /.

      --timeout TIMEOUT; default="5s"

         If Google Compute Engine doesn't receive an HTTP 200 response from the
         instance by the time specified by the value of this flag, the health
         check request is considered a failure. For example, specifying 10s will
         cause the check to wait for 10 seconds before considering the request a
         failure. Valid units for this flag are s for seconds, m for minutes,
         and h for hours. The default value is 5s.

      --unhealthy-threshold UNHEALTHY_THRESHOLD; default="2"

         The number of consecutive health check failures before a healthy
         instance is marked as unhealthy. The default is 2.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
