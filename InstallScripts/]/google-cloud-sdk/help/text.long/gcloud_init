NAME

      gcloud init - create and initialize a gcloud workspace in the current
         directory

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud init PROJECT [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID]
         [--quiet, -q] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      This command is creates and initializes a local workspace for a Google
      Cloud Platform project.

      The local workspace is indicated by the creation of a [.gcloud] folder. In
      this folder is a file [properties] which allows you to override any global
      properties you may have set via the $ gcloud config command.

      When you run a Cloud SDK command-line tool from within this new workspace,
      it will use the new [properties] file as the first place to load
      properties. As a result, if you use gcloud, gcutil, gsutil, or any of the
      other commands in google-cloud-sdk/bin from within the workspace, they
      will connect to the correct project.

      If you have enabled push-to-deploy in the Cloud Console, one of the things
      that gcloud init will do for you is cloning the Google-hosted git
      repository associated with PROJECT. This repository will automatically be
      connected to Google, and it will use the credentials indicated as active
      by gcloud auth list. Pushing to the origin's master branch will trigger an
      App Engine deployment using the contents of that branch.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      PROJECT

         The name of the Google Cloud Platform project that you want to use in a
         local workspace that will be created by this command. If this project
         has an associated Google-hosted git repository, that repository will be
         cloned into the local workspace.

FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To perform a simple "Hello, world!" App Engine deployment with this
      command, run the following command lines with MYPROJECT replaced by a
      project you own and can use for this experiment.

        $ gcloud auth login
        $ gcloud init MYPROJECT
        $ cd MYPROJECT/default
        $ git pull
          https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-helloworld-python
        $ git push origin master
