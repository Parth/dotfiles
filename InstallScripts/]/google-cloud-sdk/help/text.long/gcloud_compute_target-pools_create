NAME

      gcloud compute target-pools create - define a load-balanced pool of
         virtual machine instances

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-pools create NAME [--backup-pool BACKUP_POOL]
         [--description DESCRIPTION] [--failover-ratio FAILOVER_RATIO]
         [--format FORMAT] [--health-check HEALTH_CHECK] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--region REGION]
         [--session-affinity SESSION_AFFINITY; default="NONE"]
         [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-pools create is used to create a target pool. A
      target pool resource defines a group of instances that can receive
      incoming traffic from forwarding rules. When a forwarding rule directs
      traffic to a target pool, Google Compute Engine picks an instance from the
      target pool based on a hash of the source and destination IP addresses and
      ports. For more information on load balancing, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

      To add instances to a target pool, use 'gcloud compute target-pools
      add-instances'.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target pool.

FLAGS

      --backup-pool BACKUP_POOL

         Together with --failover-ratio, this flag defines the fallback behavior
         of the target pool (primary pool) to be created by this command. If the
         ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below the
         specified --failover-ratio value, then traffic arriving at the
         load-balanced IP address will be directed to the backup pool. If this
         flag is provided, then --failover-ratio is required.

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional description of this target pool.

      --failover-ratio FAILOVER_RATIO

         Together with --backup-pool, defines the fallback behavior of the
         target pool (primary pool) to be created by this command. If the ratio
         of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this
         number, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP address will be
         directed to the backup pool. For example, if 0.4 is chosen as the
         failover ratio, then traffic will fail over to the backup pool if more
         than 40% of the instances become unhealthy. If not set, the traffic
         will be directed the instances in this pool in the force mode, where
         traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort,
         or to all instances when no instance is healthy. If this flag is
         provided, then --backup-pool is required.

      --health-check HEALTH_CHECK

         Specifies an HTTP health check resource to use to determine the health
         of instances in this pool. If no health check is specified, traffic
         will be sent to all instances in this target pool as if the instances
         were healthy, but the health status of this pool will appear as
         unhealthy as a warning that this target pool does not have a health
         check.

      --region REGION

         The region of the target pool to create. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

      --session-affinity SESSION_AFFINITY; default="NONE"

         Specifies the session affinity option for the connection. If NONE is
         selected, then connections from the same client IP address may go to
         any instance in the target pool. If CLIENT_IP is selected, then
         connections from the same client IP address will go to the same
         instance in the target pool. If CLIENT_IP_PROTO is selected, then
         connections from the same client IP with the same IP protocol will go
         to the same client pool. If not specified, then NONE is used as a
         default.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
