NAME

      gcloud compute addresses create - reserve IP addresses

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute addresses create [NAME ...]
         [--addresses ADDRESS [ADDRESS ...]] [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q]
         [--global | --region REGION] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute addresses create is used to reserve one or more IP
      addresses. Once an IP address is reserved, it will be associated with the
      project until it is released using 'gcloud compute addresses delete'.
      Ephemeral IP addresses that are in use by resources in the project, can be
      reserved using the --addresses flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      [NAME ...]

         The names to assign to the reserved IP addresses.

FLAGS

      --addresses ADDRESS [ADDRESS ...]

         Ephemeral IP addresses to promote to reserved status. Only addresses
         that are being used by resources in the project can be promoted. When
         providing this flag, a parallel list of names for the addresses can be
         provided. For example,

           $ gcloud compute addresses create ADDRESS-1 ADDRESS-2 \
               --addresses 162.222.181.197 162.222.181.198 --region us-central1

         will result in 162.222.181.197 being reserved as 'ADDRESS-1' and
         162.222.181.198 as 'ADDRESS-2'. If no names are given,
         randomly-generated names will be assigned to the IP addresses.

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional textual description for the addresses.

      --global

         If provided, it is assumed the addresses are global.

      --region REGION

         The region of the address to operate on. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To reserve three IP addresses in the us-central1 region, run:

        $ gcloud compute addresses create ADDRESS-1 ADDRESS-2 ADDRESS-3 \
            --region us-central1

      To reserve ephemeral IP addresses 162.222.181.198 and 23.251.146.189 which
      are being used by virtual machine instances in the us-central1 region,
      run:

        $ gcloud compute addresses create --addresses 162.222.181.198 \
            23.251.146.189 --region us-central1

      In the above invocation, the two addresses will be assigned random names.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
