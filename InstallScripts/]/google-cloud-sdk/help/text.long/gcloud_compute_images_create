      gcloud compute images create - create Google Compute Engine images

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute images create NAME [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q]
         [--source-disk-zone SOURCE_DISK_ZONE] [--source-disk SOURCE_DISK |
          --source-uri SOURCE_URI] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute images create is used to create custom disk images. The
      resulting image can be provided during instance or disk creation so that
      the instance attached to the resulting disks has access to a known set of
      software or files from the image.

      Images can be created from gzipped compressed tarball containing raw disk
      data or from existing disks in any zone.

      Images are global resources, so they can be used across zones and
      projects.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the image to create.

FLAGS

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the image being created.

      --source-disk SOURCE_DISK

         A source disk to create the image from. The value for this option can
         be the name of a disk with the zone specified via --source-disk-zone
         flag.

         This flag is mutually exclusive with --source-uri.

      --source-disk-zone SOURCE_DISK_ZONE

         The zone of the disk specified by --source-disk.

                 If not specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

      --source-uri SOURCE_URI

         The full Google Cloud Storage URI where the disk image is stored. This
         file must be a gzip-compressed tarball whose name ends in .tar.gz.

         This flag is mutually exclusive with --source-disk.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
