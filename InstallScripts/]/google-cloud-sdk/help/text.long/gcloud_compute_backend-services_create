      gcloud compute backend-services create - create a backend service

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute backend-services create NAME [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--http-health-checks HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK [HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK ...]]
         [--port PORT] [--port-name PORT_NAME] [--project PROJECT_ID]
         [--protocol PROTOCOL; default="HTTP"] [--quiet, -q]
         [--timeout TIMEOUT; default="30s"] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute backend-services create is used to create backend services.
      Backend services define groups of backends that can receive traffic. Each
      backend group has parameters that define the group's capacity (e.g., max
      CPU utilization, max queries per second, ...). URL maps define which
      requests are sent to which backend services.

      Backend services created through this command will start out without any
      backend groups. To add backend groups, use 'gcloud compute
      backend-services add-backend' or 'gcloud compute backend-services edit'.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the backend service.

FLAGS

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the backend service.

      --http-health-checks HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK [HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK ...]

         Specifies a list of HTTP health check objects for checking the health
         of the backend service.

      --port PORT

         The TCP port to use when connecting to the backend. --port is being
         deprecated in favor of --port-name.

      --port-name PORT_NAME

         The name of a service that has been added to an instance group in this
         backend. Instance group services map a name to a port number which is
         used by the load balancing service. Only one port-name may be added to
         a backend service, and that name must exist as a service on all
         instance groups that are a part of this backend service. The port
         number associated with the name may differ between instances. If you do
         not specify this flag, your instance groups must have a service named
         http configured. See **gcloud preview instance-groups add-service(1)
         for details.

      --protocol PROTOCOL; default="HTTP"

         The protocol for incoming requests.

      --timeout TIMEOUT; default="30s"

         The amount of time to wait for a backend to respond to a request before
         considering the request failed. For example, specifying 10s will give
         backends 10 seconds to respond to requests. Valid units for this flag
         are s for seconds, m for minutes, and h for hours.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
