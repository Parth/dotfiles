DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute routes create is used to create routes. A route is a rule
      that specifies how certain packets should be handled by the virtual
      network. Routes are associated with virtual machine instances by tag, and
      the set of routes for a particular VM is called its routing table. For
      each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system searches that machine's
      routing table for a single best matching route.

      Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
      specific ranges over larger ones (see --destination-range). If there is a
      tie, the system selects the route with the smallest priority value. If
      there is still a tie, it uses the layer three and four packet headers to
      select just one of the remaining matching routes. The packet is then
      forwarded as specified by --next-hop-address, --next-hop-instance, or
      --next-hop-gateway of the winning route. Packets that do not match any
      route in the sending virtual machine routing table will be dropped.

      Exactly one of --next-hop-address, --next-hop-gateway, or
      --next-hop-instance must be provided with this command.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name to assign to the route.

FLAGS

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the route.

      --destination-range DESTINATION_RANGE

         The destination range of outgoing packets that the route will apply to.
         To match all traffic, use 0.0.0.0/0.

      --network NETWORK; default="default"

         Specifies the network to which the route will be applied.

      --next-hop-address NEXT_HOP_ADDRESS

         Specifies the IP address of an instance that should handle matching
         packets. The instance must have IP forwarding enabled (i.e., include
         --can-ip-forward when creating the instance using 'gcloud compute
         instances create')

      --next-hop-gateway NEXT_HOP_GATEWAY

         Specifies the gateway that should handle matching packets. Currently,
         the only acceptable value is default-internet-gateway which is a
         gateway operated by Google Compute Engine.

      --next-hop-instance NEXT_HOP_INSTANCE

         Specifies the name of an instance that should handle traffic matching
         this route. When this flag is specified, the zone of the instance must
         be specified using --next-hop-instance-zone.

      --next-hop-instance-zone NEXT_HOP_INSTANCE_ZONE

         The zone of the next hop instance.

                 If not specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

      --priority PRIORITY; default="1000"

         Specifies the priority of this route relative to other routes with the
         same specifity. The lower the value, the higher the priority.

      --tags TAG [TAG ...]

         Identifies the set of instances that this route will apply to. If no
         tags are provided, the route will apply to all instances in the
         network.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
