DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute backend-services add-backend is used to add a backend to a
      backend service. A backend is a group of tasks that can handle requests
      sent to a backend service. Currently, the group of tasks can be one or
      more Google Compute Engine virtual machine instances grouped together
      using a resource view.

      Traffic is first spread evenly across all virtual machines in the group.
      When the group is full, traffic is sent to the next nearest group(s) that
      still have remaining capacity.

      To modify the parameters of a backend after it has been added to the
      backend service, use 'gcloud compute backend-services update-backend' or
      'gcloud compute backend-services edit'.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the backend service.

FLAGS

      --balancing-mode BALANCING_MODE

         Defines the strategy for balancing load. UTILIZATION will rely on the
         CPU utilization of the tasks in the group when balancing load. When
         using UTILIZATION, --max-utilization can be used to set a maximum
         target CPU utilization for each task. RATE will spread load based on
         how many requests per second (RPS) the group can handle. There are two
         ways to specify max RPS: --max-rate which defines the max RPS for the
         whole group or --max-rate-per-task which defines the max RPS on a
         per-task basis.

         In UTILIZATION, you can optionally limit based on RPS in addition to
         CPU by setting either --max-rate-per-task or --max-rate.

      --capacity-scaler CAPACITY_SCALER

         A float in the range [0.0, 1.0] that scales the maximum parameters for
         the group (e.g., max rate). A value of 0.0 will cause no requests to be
         sent to the group (i.e., it adds the group in a drained state). The
         default is 1.0.

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the backend.

      --group GROUP

         The name or URI of a Google Cloud Resource View that can receive
         traffic.

      --max-rate MAX_RATE

         Maximum requests per second (RPS) that the group can handle.

      --max-rate-per-instance MAX_RATE_PER_INSTANCE

         The maximum per-instance requests per second (RPS).

      --max-utilization MAX_UTILIZATION

         The target CPU utilization for the group as a float in the range [0,
         1e6]. This flag can only be provided when the balancing mode is
         UTILIZATION.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the resource view to add to the backend service. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
