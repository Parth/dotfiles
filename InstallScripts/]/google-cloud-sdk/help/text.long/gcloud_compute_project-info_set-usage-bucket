NAME

      gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket - set the usage reporting
         bucket for a project

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket --bucket [BUCKET]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--prefix PREFIX] [--project PROJECT_ID]
         [--quiet, -q] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket is used to configure usage
      reporting for projects.

      Setting usage reporting will cause a log of usage per resource to be
      written to a specified Google Cloud Storage bucket daily. For example,

        $ gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket --bucket gs://my-bucket

      will cause logs of the form usage_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv to be written daily to
      the bucket my-bucket. To disable this feature, issue the command:

        $ gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket --bucket

FLAGS

      --bucket [BUCKET]

         The URI of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where the usage report object
         should be stored. The Google Service Account for performing usage
         reporting is granted write access to this bucket. The user running this
         command must be an owner of the bucket.

         To clear the usage bucket, specify this flag without an argument:

           $ gcloud compute project-info set-usage-bucket --bucket

      --prefix PREFIX

         An optional prefix for the name of the usage report object stored in
         the bucket. If not supplied, then this defaults to usage. The report is
         stored as a CSV file named PREFIX_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv where YYYYMMDD is
         the day of the usage according to Pacific Time. The prefix should
         conform to Google Cloud Storage object naming conventions. This flag
         must not be provided when clearing the usage bucket.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
