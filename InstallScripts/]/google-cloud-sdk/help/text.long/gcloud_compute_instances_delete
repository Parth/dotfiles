NAME

      gcloud compute instances delete - delete Google Compute Engine virtual
         machine instances

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances delete NAME [NAME ...]
         [--delete-disks {boot,data,all} | --keep-disks {boot,data,all}]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q]
         [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [--zone ZONE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances delete deletes one or more Google Compute Engine
      virtual machine instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME [NAME ...]

         The names of the instances to delete.

FLAGS

      --delete-disks {boot,data,all}

         The types of disks to delete with instance deletion regardless of the
         disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the
         auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly before
         the instance deletion requests are issued. For more information on disk
         auto-deletion, see
         https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/disks#updateautodelete.

      --keep-disks {boot,data,all}

         The types of disks to not delete with instance deletion regardless of
         the disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the
         auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly before
         the instance deletion requests are issued. For more information on disk
         auto-deletion, see
         https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/disks#updateautodelete.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instances to delete. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
