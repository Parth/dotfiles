      gcloud compute target-pools add-health-checks - add an HTTP health check
         to a target pool

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-pools add-health-checks NAME [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] --http-health-check HEALTH_CHECK [--project PROJECT_ID]
         [--quiet, -q] [--region REGION] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-pools add-health-checks is used to add an HTTP
      health check to a target pool. Health checks are used to determine the
      health status of instances in the target pool. Only one health check can
      be attached to a target pool, so this command will fail if there as
      already a health check attached to the target pool. For more information
      on health checks and load balancing, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target pool to which to add the health check.

FLAGS

      --http-health-check HEALTH_CHECK

         Specifies an HTTP health check object to add to the target pool.

      --region REGION

         The region of the target pool to add health checks to. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
