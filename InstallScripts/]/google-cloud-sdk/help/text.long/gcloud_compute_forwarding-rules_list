NAME

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules list - list forwarding rules

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules list [NAME ...] [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--limit LIMIT] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q]
         [--regexp REGEXP, -r REGEXP] [--global | --regions [REGION ...]]
         [--sort-by SORT_BY] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [--uri] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules list lists summary information of
      forwarding rules in a project. The --uri option can be used to display
      URIs instead. Users who want to see more data should use 'gcloud compute
      forwarding-rules describe'.

      By default, global forwarding rules and forwarding rules from all regions
      are listed. The results can be narrowed down by providing the --regions or
      --global flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      [NAME ...]

         If provided, show details for the specified names and/or URIs of
         resources.

FLAGS

      --global

         If provided, only global resources are shown.

      --limit LIMIT

         The maximum number of results.

      --regexp REGEXP, -r REGEXP

         A regular expression to filter the names of the results on. Any names
         that do not match the entire regular expression will be filtered out.

      --regions [REGION ...]

         If provided, only regional resources are shown. If arguments are
         provided, only resources from the given regions are shown.

      --sort-by SORT_BY

         A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
         value of this flag with a tilde (~).

      --uri

         If provided, the list command will only print URIs for the resources
         returned. If this flag is not provided, the list command will print a
         human-readable table of useful resource data.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To list all forwarding rules in a project in table form, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list

      To list the URIs of all forwarding rules in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --uri

      To list all of the global forwarding rules in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --global

      To list all of the regional forwarding rules in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --regions

      To list all of the forwarding rules from the us-central1 and the
      europe-west1 regions, run:

        $ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list --regions us-central1 \
            europe-west1
