NAME

      gcloud compute instances detach-disk - detach disks from Compute Engine
         virtual machine instances

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances detach-disk NAME [--device-name DEVICE_NAME |
          --disk DISK] [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID]
         [--quiet, -q] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [--zone ZONE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances detach-disk is used to detach disks from virtual
      machines.

      Detaching a disk without first unmounting it may result in incomplete I/O
      operations and data corruption. To unmount a persistent disk on a
      Linux-based image, ssh into the instance and run:

        $ sudo umount /dev/disk/by-id/google-DEVICE_NAME

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the instance to detach the disk from.

FLAGS

      --device-name DEVICE_NAME

         Specifies a disk to detach by its device name, which is the name that
         the guest operating system sees. The device name is set at the time
         that the disk is attached to the instance, and needs not be the same as
         the persistent disk name. If the disk's device name is specified, then
         its persistent disk name must not be specified using the --disk flag.

      --disk DISK

         Specifies a disk to detach by its resource name. If you specify a disk
         to remove by persistent disk name, then you must not specify its device
         name using the --device-name flag.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to detach a disk from. If not specified, you
         will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
