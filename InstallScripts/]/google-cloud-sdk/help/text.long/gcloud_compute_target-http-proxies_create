SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-http-proxies create NAME [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q]
         [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] --url-map URL_MAP [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-http-proxies create is used to create target HTTP
      proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules
      which define which packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The
      target HTTP proxy points to a URL map that defines the rules for routing
      the requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend services which
      handle the actual requests.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target HTTP proxy.

      --url-map URL_MAP

         A reference to a URL map resource that defines the mapping of URLs to
         backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while
