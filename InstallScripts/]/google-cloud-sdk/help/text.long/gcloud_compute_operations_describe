POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the resource to fetch.

FLAGS

      --global

         If provided, it is assumed that the requested operation is global.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the operation to fetch.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

      To get details about a global operation, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations describe OPERATION --global

      To get details about a regional operation, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations describe OPERATION --region us-central1

      To get details about a zonal operation, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations describe OPERATION --zone us-central1-a
