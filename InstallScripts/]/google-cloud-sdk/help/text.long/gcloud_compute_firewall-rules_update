SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute firewall-rules update NAME [--allow [PROTOCOL[:PORT[-PORT]]
         ...]] [--description DESCRIPTION] [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--source-ranges [CIDR_RANGE ...]]

         [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute firewall-rules update is used to update firewall rules that
      allow incoming traffic to a network. Only arguments passed in will be
      updated on the firewall rule. Other attributes will remain unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the firewall rule to update.

FLAGS

      --allow [PROTOCOL[:PORT[-PORT]] ...]

         A list of protocols and ports whose traffic will be allowed. Setting
         this will override the current values.

         PROTOCOL is the IP protocol whose traffic will be allowed. PROTOCOL can
         be either the name of a well-known protocol (e.g., tcp or icmp) or the
         IP protocol number. A list of IP protocols can be found at
         http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml.

         A port or port range can be specified after PROTOCOL to allow traffic
         through specific ports. If no port or port range is specified,
         connections through all ranges are allowed. For example, the following
         will create a rule that allows TCP traffic through port 80 and allows
         ICMP traffic:

           $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE --allow tcp:80 icmp

         TCP and UDP rules must include a port or port range.

      --description DESCRIPTION

         A textual description for the firewall rule. Set to an empty string to
         clear existing description.

      --source-ranges [CIDR_RANGE ...]

         A list of IP address blocks that are allowed to make inbound
         connections that match the firewall rule to the instances on the
         network. The IP address blocks must be specified in CIDR format:
         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing. Setting
         this will override the existing source ranges for the firewall. The
         following will clear the existing source ranges:

           $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE --source-ranges

      --source-tags [TAG ...]

         A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the network
         which may accept inbound connections that match the firewall rule. If
         omitted, all instances on the network can receive inbound connections
         that match the rule.

         Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation. Setting
         this will override the existing source tags for the firewall. The
         following will clear the existing source tags:

           $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE --source-tags

      --target-tags [TAG ...]

         A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the network
         which may make network connections that match the firewall rule. If
         omitted, all instances on the network can make connections that match
         the rule.

         Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation. Setting
         this will override the existing target tags for the firewall. The
         following will clear the existing target tags:

           $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update MY-RULE --target-tags

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
